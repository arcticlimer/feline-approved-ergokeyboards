  This repository is dedicated to ergonomic keyboards approved by our fellow
  felines.

  Do you have a cat? Do you have an ergonomic keyboard? Then this place is
  waiting for a picture of both!

<p>
  Most people say that one of the benefits of a split keyboard is to have
  the mouse/cup in the middle of them or that a compact keyboard fits
  better on the desk. <strong>We disagree!</strong>
